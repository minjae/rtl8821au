# rtl8821au
Linux driver for wireless adapters with Realtek rtl8811au/rtl8812au/rtl8821au chipsets

The projects strives support recent kernel versions (>= 4.11) as then-publicly available drivers
lacked support for said kernel versions. (EDIT: Kernel 4.15+ support has been added to the project.)

The original source code is from `rtl8821AU_WiFi_linux_v5.2.6.2_23547.20170814_COEX20170206-6760`
that came with a rtl8811au wireless USB adapter.  This driver is newer (v5) than what is publicly
available online at the time (v4 or older).  If you find a newer version of manufacturer driver, please
let us know.
